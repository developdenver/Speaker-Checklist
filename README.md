# Develop Denver Speaker Checklist 

## Before 
* [ ] Rehearse out loud, but don't overdo it.
* [ ] Planning a talk in your head and saying the words out loud are two different skills. Make sure you practice your talk. 
* [ ] Rehearse out loud to help you write the talk, not just when you‚Äôre ‚Äúdone.‚Äù 

### Avoid Over-Rehearsing
* [ ] Decide if you want to have notes, and add them to your slide deck, or put them on paper. 

### Get Feedback 
* [ ] Give at least a part of your talk in front of another human and get feedback. Make changes based on that feedback.

### Build Your Slidedeck
* [ ] Spell check your slides.
* [ ] Have a backup copy of your slides in case of issues with the internet. 
    * [ ] Many presentation platforms have an option to export your slides as a PDF.
* [ ] Keep the text on each slide short and powerful. Ideally, each slide could be a tweet on its own. 
* [ ] Credit your sources (code or design samples, images and gifs, etc.) especially if the material is copyrighted. 
* [ ] Include a slide that lists relevant resources from your talk.
* [ ] Ensure your final slide says ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and shows your contact info (twitter, github, dribble, personal website, etc.).

### Have a Contingency Plan
* [ ] What will you do if the screen goes out? Network dies? Video won‚Äôt play? Your live demo stops working? 
    * [ ] Record a screencast and have it saved on your computer if you are planning a live demo.

## During 
### Notifications
* [ ] Silence notifications on your computer and your phone. 

### Microphones
* [ ] Use the microphone. This is required so that people with impaired hearing can hear you and so you can be heard on the video recording or if there is live-captioning. 
* [ ] Get closer to the microphone than you think you should (1-3 inches)

### Posture and Position and Poise
* [ ] Don‚Äôt lean on the podium.
* [ ] Don‚Äôt use the podium to shield you from the audience.
* [ ] Open your body language.
* [ ] Talk slower than you think you should.

## After
* [ ] Add your slide deck and contact info to this github repo: [https://github.com/developdenver/2019-dvlpdnvr-talks](https://github.com/developdenver/2019-dvlpdnvr-talks)
* [ ] Great speakers thank their attendees and share their resources, so if you have a twitter account, send a tweet thanking people who attended and share your resources, including your slide deck. Use the hashtag #dvlpdnvr.
* [ ] Celebrate! Preparing and giving a conference talk is a lot of work and you‚Äôre done! üéâ
